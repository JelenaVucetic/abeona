    "about-us-intro-2": " Abeona's name comes from the Latin verb abeo, \"to depart, go away, or go forth\". She was believed to especially guard children as they took their first steps away from home to explore the world, an anxious time for parents, perhaps reflected in the fact that abeo carries the added meaning of \"to die, disappear, or be changed\". Abeona watched over any \"first steps\", whether literal or metaphoric. With Her associate Adiona, Abeona was believed to teach toddlers to walk. And when that child grew up and left home—whether due to marriage, college, or to make his or her way in the world—Abeona was there to ease the fears of the parents and guard their son or daughter.",
